Abstract:

The aim of this thesis is to explore and evaluate the effectiveness of Transformer architectures in the context of
multi-channel data classification/regression, with a specific focus on biometric datasets like MIMIC. The widespread
adoption of Transformer models in natural language processing and computer vision tasks has shown their capacity to
capture intricate dependencies in sequential data, making them a promising candidate for processing multi-channel data
from various sources simultaneously.

Objectives:

1. **Design and Implementation of Multi-channel Transformer Architecture:**
   Develop specialized Transformer architecture tailored for handling multi-channel data. Considerations will be made
   for accommodating the unique characteristics of biometric datasets, such as temporal dependencies, varying signal
   modalities (numerical, categorical), missing data points, and the need for robust feature extraction.
2. **Performance Evaluation:**
   Conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed Transformer architecture for multi-channel data classification on
   biometric datasets, such as MIMIC. Assess the models' accuracy, efficiency, and scalability in comparison to existing
   methods. We will evaluate the model on the 1 or 2 machine learning tasks (regressions or classification). Examples of
   such tasks include, but not limited to: sleep apnea prediction or classification of a diagnosis coded using ICD
   ontology.

The thesis will contribute to the evolving field of biometric data processing by offering novel insights into the
application of Transformer architectures for multi-channel data classification/regression. The findings will be valuable
for researchers, practitioners, and developers working on biometric systems, healthcare applications, and other domains
requiring the analysis of complex, multi-modal datasets.
